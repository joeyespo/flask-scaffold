Flask Scaffold
--------------

A scaffold for quickly developing a Flask project.
This Flask application assumes that a virtualenv is installed at ~/env/[appname].

When making code changes, be sure to 'touch' the tmp/restart.txt file to signal
a restart to Passenger on the production server.


TODO
----

- Replace all [appname], [author], and [description] occurrences with your own app info.
- Replace this file with a README for your own app.
